## Why Are Illegal Bins Important in SystemVerilog?

- **Constrained Random Verification:** Illegal bins prevent the testbench from generating values that would violate design rules, focusing the verification effort on legal and interesting scenarios.
- **Improved Code Coverage:** By explicitly excluding illegal values, you can achieve higher and more meaningful code coverage.
- **Faster Debugging:** Identifying and preventing illegal value generation early on simplifies debugging, saving time and resources.

This free course module specifically covers:
✔ **Understanding Bin Definitions:** Learn the basics of defining bins, including auto bins and user-defined bins.
✔ **Specifying Illegal Bins:** Mastering the syntax and methods for defining illegal bins to constrain random stimulus.
✔ **Practical Examples:** See real-world examples of how illegal bins are used in verification environments to prevent errors.
