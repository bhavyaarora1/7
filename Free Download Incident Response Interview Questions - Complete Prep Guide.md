## Common Incident Response Interview Questions (and How to Answer Them)

Here's a breakdown of common interview questions, along with suggested approaches to answering them.

### 1. "Walk me through your experience with incident response."

This is your opportunity to showcase your practical experience. Don't just list tasks; tell a story.

*   **Example Answer:** "In my previous role at [Company Name], I was part of the incident response team. On one occasion, we detected a potential ransomware attack through our SIEM system. I immediately isolated the affected machine from the network and initiated our incident response plan. I analyzed the logs to determine the source of the attack, identified the compromised accounts, and worked with our IT team to restore the affected data from backups. Throughout the process, I documented every step we took and communicated updates to management and other stakeholders. We successfully contained the attack, minimized data loss, and implemented additional security measures to prevent future incidents."

**Key Takeaways:** Use the **STAR method** (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to structure your response. Highlight your contributions and the positive outcomes.
