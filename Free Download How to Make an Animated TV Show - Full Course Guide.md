## Understanding the Animated TV Show Landscape

Before diving into the specifics, it's important to understand the current animation landscape. Animation is booming, with shows like "Rick and Morty," "Bob's Burgers," and "Arcane" achieving critical acclaim and massive viewership. This surge in popularity has opened doors for independent creators and smaller studios. However, it also means increased competition. Standing out requires not only a compelling story but also a solid understanding of the production process and the business side of animation.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Making an Animated TV Show

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the key steps involved in creating your animated TV show:

### 1. Concept Development

This is the foundation of your entire project. A strong concept will attract talented artists, writers, and, eventually, a network or streaming service.

*   **Brainstorming:** Generate as many ideas as possible. Don't be afraid to think outside the box. Consider different genres, target audiences, and unique themes.
*   **Logline:** Distill your idea into a single, compelling sentence that summarizes the premise of your show.
*   **Synopsis:** Expand on your logline, providing a more detailed overview of the story, characters, and world.
*   **Target Audience:** Define who you are creating this show for. Understanding your target demographic will influence your writing style, animation style, and marketing strategy.

### 2. Writing the Pilot Episode

The pilot episode is crucial. Itâ€™s your opportunity to hook viewers and convince them that your show is worth watching.

*   **Script Format:** Learn the standard script format for animated television. This ensures your script is professional and easy to read.
*   **Character Development:** Create well-defined characters with distinct personalities, motivations, and flaws.
*   **Story Structure:** Follow a classic story structure, such as the Hero's Journey, to ensure your plot is engaging and compelling.
*   **Dialogue:** Write natural and engaging dialogue that reflects the characters' personalities and advances the plot.
*   **Scene Descriptions:** Provide clear and concise descriptions of the scenes, including visual cues for the animators.

### 3. Creating a Pitch Bible

The pitch bible is a comprehensive document that outlines every aspect of your show, from the characters and setting to the overall tone and themes. This is what you'll use to pitch your show to networks and streaming services.

*   **Character Designs:** Include detailed character designs, showcasing their appearance, clothing, and expressions.
*   **Environment Designs:** Create concept art for the main locations in your show, showcasing their atmosphere and style.
*   **Story Arcs:** Outline the major story arcs for the first season, giving potential investors a sense of where the show is headed.
*   **Target Audience Demographics:** Clearly define your target audience and explain why your show will appeal to them.
*   **Marketing and Distribution Plan:** Outline your strategy for marketing and distributing your show, including potential partnerships and platforms.

### 4. Animatic and Pilot Production

An animatic is a preliminary version of the episode, using storyboard panels synchronized with audio. This allows you to visualize the pacing, timing, and overall flow of the episode before investing in full animation.

*   **Storyboarding:** Create detailed storyboards for each scene, visualizing the action and camera angles.
*   **Voice Acting:** Record voice acting for the characters, bringing them to life and adding emotion to the animatic.
*   **Sound Effects and Music:** Add sound effects and music to enhance the atmosphere and create a more immersive experience.
*   **Editing:** Edit the animatic together, refining the timing and pacing to create a polished presentation.

  **Developing a pilot episode is the next logical step after an animatic.** If the animatic is well-received, creating a short, fully-animated pilot episode can significantly enhance your chances of getting your series picked up. A polished pilot allows you to showcase the show's visual style, animation quality, and overall potential to investors and networks.

### 5. Financing and Funding

Securing funding is one of the biggest challenges for independent animation projects.

*   **Self-Funding:** Use your own savings or investments to fund the project.
*   **Crowdfunding:** Launch a crowdfunding campaign on platforms like Kickstarter or Indiegogo to raise money from fans.
*   **Grants and Competitions:** Apply for grants and participate in animation competitions to win funding and exposure.
*   **Investors:** Pitch your show to investors, showcasing its potential for commercial success.
*   **Production Companies:** Partner with a production company that can provide funding and resources.

### 6. Animation Production

Once you have funding, you can begin the animation production process.

*   **Character Rigging:** Create digital rigs for your characters, allowing them to be animated efficiently.
*   **Animation:** Animate each scene, bringing the characters and story to life.
*   **Backgrounds:** Create detailed backgrounds that complement the animation and enhance the visual style.
*   **Effects:** Add special effects, such as explosions, magic, or weather effects, to enhance the visual impact.
*   **Compositing:** Combine all the elements together, adding finishing touches like color correction and lighting.

### 7. Post-Production

Post-production involves finalizing the audio and visual elements of your show.

*   **Sound Design:** Create sound effects and music that enhance the atmosphere and create a more immersive experience.
*   **Mixing:** Mix the audio tracks together, ensuring that the dialogue, sound effects, and music are balanced.
*   **Editing:** Finalize the editing of the episodes, ensuring that the pacing and timing are perfect.
*   **Color Correction:** Adjust the colors to create a consistent and visually appealing look.

### 8. Distribution and Marketing

Getting your show seen is crucial for success.

*   **Film Festivals:** Submit your show to film festivals to gain exposure and recognition.
*   **Online Platforms:** Upload your show to online platforms like YouTube, Vimeo, and Patreon.
*   **Social Media:** Promote your show on social media, engaging with fans and building a following.
*   **Networking:** Attend industry events and network with other animators, producers, and distributors.
*   **Direct Sales:** Sell your show directly to fans through online platforms or your own website.

### 9. Pitching to Networks/Streaming Services

This is the big leagues. Getting your show picked up by a network or streaming service can catapult your career.

*   **Research:** Research different networks and streaming services to identify those that are a good fit for your show.
*   **Connections:** Leverage your network to get introductions to executives and decision-makers.
*   **Pitch Deck:** Prepare a professional pitch deck that showcases your show's concept, characters, and potential.
*   **Practice:** Practice your pitch until you can deliver it confidently and persuasively.
*   **Persistence:** Don't give up if you face rejection. Keep refining your pitch and keep trying.
