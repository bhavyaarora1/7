## Understanding the Fundamentals of Investing

Before diving into the specifics of an investing course, let's cover some fundamental concepts that every investor should understand:

*   **Assets:** An asset is anything you own that has economic value. Examples include stocks, bonds, real estate, and commodities.
*   **Stocks:** Represent ownership in a company. Investing in stocks gives you a share of the company's profits and losses.
*   **Bonds:** Represent a loan you make to a company or government. Bonds typically pay a fixed interest rate over a specific period.
*   **Mutual Funds:** A portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other assets managed by a professional fund manager. Mutual funds offer diversification and convenience.
*   **Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs):** Similar to mutual funds, but traded on stock exchanges like individual stocks.
*   **Diversification:** Spreading your investments across different asset classes to reduce risk.
*   **Risk Tolerance:** Your ability to withstand potential losses in your investments.
*   **Time Horizon:** The length of time you plan to invest.
*   **Return on Investment (ROI):** The percentage gain or loss on an investment.
*   **Inflation:** The rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services is rising, and subsequently, purchasing power is falling. Understanding inflation is critical to ensuring your investments outpace it.
*   **Compounding:** The process of earning returns on your initial investment and the accumulated interest or profits. Compounding is a powerful tool for wealth building.
