## What is Impressionism? Understanding the Movement

Impressionism emerged in the late 19th century as a radical departure from academic painting traditions. **Key characteristics of Impressionism** include:

*   **Emphasis on Light and Color:** Capturing the fleeting effects of light and atmospheric conditions was paramount. Artists sought to portray the world as they saw it, focusing on the immediate sensory experience.
*   **Broken Brushstrokes:** Instead of meticulously blending colors, Impressionists used short, broken brushstrokes to create a sense of movement and vibrancy.
*   **Painting en Plein Air:** Many Impressionist works were painted outdoors ("en plein air" in French) to directly observe and capture the nuances of natural light.
*   **Everyday Subject Matter:** Impressionists often depicted scenes from modern life, such as landscapes, cityscapes, and portraits of ordinary people.
*   **Rejection of Realism:** Unlike Realist painters who aimed for accurate representation, Impressionists prioritized capturing the impression of a scene rather than its precise details.

## Why Learn Impressionist Oil Painting?

Learning Impressionist oil painting offers numerous benefits for artists of all levels:

*   **Develop Observational Skills:** Training your eye to see light, color, and form is crucial for any artist, and Impressionism provides an excellent framework for honing these skills.
*   **Master Color Mixing Techniques:** Impressionism emphasizes the use of vibrant colors and subtle gradations. By studying Impressionist techniques, you'll learn how to mix colors effectively and create luminous effects.
*   **Improve Brushwork Control:** The broken brushstrokes characteristic of Impressionism require precise control and experimentation. Practicing these techniques will improve your overall brushwork skills.
*   **Gain a Deeper Appreciation for Art History:** Impressionism is a pivotal movement in art history. Understanding its origins, influences, and impact will enrich your understanding of art as a whole.
*   **Express Yourself Creatively:** Impressionism encourages a loose, expressive style that allows you to explore your own unique artistic vision.

## Getting Started: Essential Materials for Impressionist Oil Painting

Before diving into the free course, gather these essential materials:

*   **Oil Paints:** A range of colors is essential, including primary colors (red, yellow, blue), secondary colors (green, orange, violet), and earth tones (burnt umber, raw sienna). Consider purchasing a starter set of oil paints to begin with.
*   **Brushes:** A variety of brush sizes and shapes is recommended. Round brushes are useful for details, while flat brushes are ideal for covering larger areas. Bristle brushes are commonly used for Impressionist techniques.
*   **Palette:** A palette is a flat surface used for mixing paints. A wooden or glass palette is ideal for oil painting.
*   **Palette Knife:** A palette knife is used for mixing paints and applying paint to the canvas in thick layers.
*   **Canvas or Painting Panel:** Stretched canvas or canvas panels are suitable surfaces for oil painting. Choose a size that is appropriate for your project.
*   **Easel:** An easel provides a stable surface for painting and allows you to work at a comfortable height.
*   **Odorless Mineral Spirits or Turpentine:** These solvents are used for thinning oil paints and cleaning brushes. Opt for odorless mineral spirits for a safer and more pleasant painting experience.
*   **Linseed Oil:** Linseed oil is used as a medium to thin oil paints and improve their flow.
*   **Rags or Paper Towels:** Rags or paper towels are essential for cleaning brushes and wiping up spills.
*   **Brush Cleaner:** Use a specialized brush cleaner to thoroughly remove oil paint from your brushes.
